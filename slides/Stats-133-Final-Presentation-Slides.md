Introduction
========================================================

**Purpose:**  
Through analysis of NBA data sets from 2015 - 2016, we answered the question, "*In the 2015-2016 season, how do the skills of a player relate to this salary?*"

Process One | Scraping
========================================================
- scraping data off NBA basetball-reference.com website to better categorize data
- Below are samples of web data input and how we loaded it

Process One Continued | Scraping
========================================================
- This function actually extracts the data from the site below

Process One Continued | Cleaning
========================================================
- This is the raw_data we have loaded into the CSVs

- This is our final output after hard cleaning work

Process Two | Exploratory Data Analysis
========================================================

- analysis of variables to calculate descriptive summaries for quantitative variables

Process Three | Principal Components Analysis
========================================================

- to compensate for drawbacks in EFF, different efficiency indices of the players' positions were taken into account
