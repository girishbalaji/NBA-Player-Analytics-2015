File Structure: File structure is similar to what is in the Open Source Framework
(OSF) Structure requirements that were given by the Professor.

Notes: The data scraping,download data,and clean data scripts get the NBA data
and clean it from the website, after which the eda-script generates summary 
statistics for each variable and puts it in a text file and saves plots of each 
variable under images. then, compuete efficiency calculates each player's value
and notes which players are the best and worst.

The shiny apps illustrate the team salaries statistics and efficiency values for
each player.
